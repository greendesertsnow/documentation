# Protected and unprotected Meilisearch projects

Meilisearch projects and self-hosted instances may be protected or unprotected.

## Protected projects

In protected projects, all Meilisearch API routes and endpoints can only be accessed by requests bearing an API key. The only exception to this rule is the `/health` endpoint, which may still be queried with unauthorized requests.

Meilisearch Cloud projects are protected by default. Self-hosted instances are only protected if you launch them with a master key.

## Unprotected projects

In unprotected projects and self-hosted instances, any user may access any API endpoint. Never leave a publicly accessible instance unprotected. Only use unprotected instances in safe development environments.

Meilisearch Cloud projects are always protected. Meilisearch self-hosted instances are unprotected by default.
