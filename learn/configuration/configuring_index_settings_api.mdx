# Configuring index settings with the settings API

This tutorial will show you how to check and change an index setting using the Settings API. You will use the `/settings/searchable-attributes` subroute, as well as the main `/settings` route.

## Requirements

- a Meilisearch Cloud project or a self-hosted Meilisearch instance with at least one index
- a command-line terminal with `curl` installed

## Getting the value of a single index setting

You can configure an index using either the main `/settings` route or a dedicated subroute. The main `/settings` route gives you access to all index settings at once, while subroutes only allow access to a single index setting.

For this tutorial, start by checking the value of the searchable attributes index setting.

Use the `GET` endpoint of the `/settings/searchable-attributes` subroute, replacing `INDEX_NAME` with your index:

```sh
curl \
  -X GET 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/INDEX_NAME/settings/searchable-attributes'
```

Depending on your setup, you might also need to replace `localhost:7700` with the appropriate address and port.

You should receive a response immediately:

```json
[
  "*"
]
```

## Updating an index setting

In most datasets, setting the primary key attribute slows as a searchable performance and does not improve relevancy. Now you know Meilisearch is currently searching through all attributes, you can improve your application search experience by changing this setting.

Use the `PUT` endpoint of the `/settings/searchable-attributes` subroute, replacing `INDEX_NAME` with your index and the sample attributes `"title"` and `"overview"` with attributes present in your dataset:

```sh
curl \
  -X PUT 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/INDEX_NAME/settings/searchable-attributes' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary '[
    "title",
    "overview"
  ]'
```

This time, Meilisearch will not process your request immediately. Instead, you will receive a summarized task object while the search engine works on updating your index setting as soon as it has enough resources:

```json
{
  "taskUid": 1,
  "indexUid": "INDEX_NAME",
  "status": "enqueued",
  "type": "settingsUpdate",
  "enqueuedAt": "2021-08-11T09:25:53.000000Z"
}
```

Processing the index setting change might take some time, depending on how many documents you have in your index. 

Wait a few seconds and use the task object's `taskUid` to monitor the status of your request:

```sh
curl \
  -X GET 'http://localhost:7700/tasks/TASK_UID'
```

Meilisearch will respond with a task object:

```json
{
  "uid":1,
  "indexUid":"INDEX_NAME",
  "status":"succeeded",
  "type":"settingsUpdate",
  …
}
```

If `status` is `enqueued` or `processed`, wait a few more moments and check the task status again. If `status` is `failed`, make sure you have used a valid index and attributes, then try again.

If task `status` is `succeeded`, you successfully updated your index's searchable attributes. Use the subroute to check the new setting's value:

```sh
curl \
  -X GET 'http://localhost:7700/indexes/INDEX_NAME/settings/searchable-attributes'
```

Meilisearch should return an array with the new values:

```json
[
  "title",
  "overview"
]
```

## Conclusion

You have used the Meilisearch API to check the value of an index setting. Then, you changed it to improve your project's performance.

This tutorial used the searchable attributes setting, but the procedure is the same no matter which index setting you are editing.
