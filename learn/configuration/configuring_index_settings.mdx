# Configuring index settings with the Meilisearch Cloud interface

This tutorial will show you how to check and change an index setting using the [Meilisearch Cloud](https://cloud.meilisearch.com) interface.

## Requirements

- an active [Meilisearch Cloud](https://cloud.meilisearch.com) account
- a Meilisearch Cloud project with at least one index

## Accessing a project's index settings

Log into your Meilisearch account and navigate to your project. Then, click on "Indexes".

Find the index you want to configure and click on its "Settings" button.

## Checking a setting's current value

First, you need to verify what is a setting's current value. Using the menu on the left-hand side, click on "Attributes".

Scroll and look for "Searchable attributes". If this is a new index, you should see the default value, `["*"]`.

## Updating a setting

In most datasets, setting the primary key attribute slows as a searchable performance and does not improve relevancy. Now you know Meilisearch is currently searching through all attributes, you can improve your application search experience by changing this setting.

Click on the input box with the current value. Then, replace it with an array of strings containing all attributes in your index except the primary key.

Two buttons will appear on the bottom of the screen when you start editing a field. Once you're finished editing a setting, click on "Save".

The button icon will change to a spinning wheel to indicate Meilisearch is processing the changes. Depending on the size of your dataset and the setting you have edited, this might take some time.

Once Meilisearch is ready, the button should change to a green color. You will also see a notification pop-up on the right-hand side of your screen.

## Conclusion

You have used the Meilisearch Cloud interface to check the value of an index setting. Then, you changed it to improve your project's performance.

This tutorial used the searchable attributes setting, but the procedure is the same no matter which index setting you are editing.
